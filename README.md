# Evaluating-different-time-series-models-to-predict-COSTCO-sales
This project trains different time series models, including VAR, Random Walk, ARIMA, OLS, and Exponential Moving Average, to predict COSTCO sales

## Introduction to Time series analysis to forecast

In this analysis, we train different time series models to predict COSTCO sales. The method basically consists of applying a rolling window to the target variable (sales), which is first made stationary using seasonal adjustment, in order to move the sample and train the models. We use the MSE to select the best model adjustment, comparing it with a NAIVE method, which consists of an Exponential Moving Average


## Data
Source and Accessibility

The financial metrics used in this analysis are sourced from Stockrow.com, a reliable provider of comprehensive financial data for publicly traded companies. This platform offers a wide array of financial metrics crucial for conducting detailed financial analyses. Personal income data was acquired from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce.

Estimation Method
Objective and Approach To estimate the fundamental price of Nike's stock, we initially identify the most predictive financial metrics. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model is then employed, selecting Sales and EBITDA as primary predictors. These metrics were chosen for their significant roles in representing revenues and profitability, respectively.

Statistical Significance and Model Efficacy The chosen variables are both statistically and economically significant, with the regression model explaining approximately 90% of the variance in Nike's stock price. This high degree of explanation underscores the robustness of the model in capturing key price drivers.

Visual Analysis The following images display the regression analysis results and the correlation matrix, visually substantiating the strong relationship between the chosen variables and the stock price:

Finally, we apply the Hodrick-Prescott filter to isolate the trend components within the Sales and EBITDA series. These components are then utilized to estimate a linear projection in our OLS model. This method facilitates an effective evaluation of these trends, enabling us to accurately predict the fundamental price of Nike stocks

ARIMA Projections
Using Fundamental stock price data, an ARIMA model will be configured to forecast the price movements for the next two years. This section will detail the selection process for the ARIMA model parameters (p, d, q) and discuss the modelâ€™s fit and forecast accuracy. The model's predictions will be compared against the estimated intrinsic values to identify potential periods where the stock might be under- or over-valued.

To select the appropriate ARIMA model, we utilize the auto.arima function in RStudio, which determines the optimal ARIMA order by minimizing the AIC criterion

Results and conclusions
The analysis results show that, over the last year, Nike's stock price has been significantly lower than its fundamental values. According to value investing theory, this presents a good opportunity to buy Nike stock at the current price due to the substantial safety margin it offers. Furthermore, if the sales and EBITDA remain relatively stable, the continued decline in current prices could present an even more compelling buying opportunity.
